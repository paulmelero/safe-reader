Safe Reader is a lightweight companion that opens any shared URL inside an isolated iframe. By stripping scripts and confining external sites to a sandbox, it helps you preview unknown links before deciding to trust them on your primary browser tabs.

The app lives entirely in the browser, so the links you paste never leave your device. Pair it with your favorite share workflows or use the search bar on the home page to paste a suspicious URL and inspect it safely.
